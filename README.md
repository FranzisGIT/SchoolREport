# Data School project summary templates

Attempt at some poster templates with a Data School flavour. To create a poster:

1. Install this package using:

```
remotes::install_github("sparce/DSreport")
```

2. Create a new RStudio project for your project summary

3. Create a new R Markdown document from the Data School project summary template

4. Edit the prefilled content of the document to describe yourself and your project

In addition, if you wish to knit the prefilled content to see how it looks before starting to create
your own project summary, you will need to make sure you have the `tidyverse`, `gapminder` and
`kableExtra` packages installed.
